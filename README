    ~ What is BuzzingBird?

      A SQLite and Flask powered Hummingbird (encrypted twitter clone), based off of MiniTwit.

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the buzzingbird.py file or
         export an BUZZINGBIRD_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. fire up a python shell and run this:

         >>> from buzzingbird import init_db; init_db()

      3. now you can run the buzzingbird.py file with your
         python interpreter and the application will
         greet you on http://localhost:5000/

    ~ Is it tested?

      You betcha.  Run the `buzzingbird_tests.py` file to
      see the tests pass.

    ~ This was written as a proof of concept for a Graduate Security course at Cal Poly State
      University, San Luis Obispo. It is not feature complete and probably never will be. It
      was built to show that idea behind Hummingbird (an encrypted twitter) could be
      implemented without a Java-backed Firefox plugin, and instead uses just Javascript.
